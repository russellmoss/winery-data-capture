- Claude API charges per token used
- Typical cost: $0.01-0.05 per insight generation
- Year-over-year analysis uses more tokens
- Consider caching insights for frequently requested periods

## Best Practices

1. **Cache Results**: Store insights for common date ranges
2. **Batch Requests**: Combine multiple analyses when possible
3. **Error Handling**: Always handle API failures gracefully
4. **Rate Limiting**: Don't exceed Anthropic's rate limits
5. **Data Quality**: Ensure clean, complete data for best insights

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Found**
   - Ensure `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in environment
   - Check that the key is valid and has credits

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implement delays between requests
   - Consider upgrading your Anthropic plan

3. **Poor Quality Insights**
   - Ensure metrics data is complete
   - Check for data anomalies or missing fields

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
```

This will provide detailed Claude API request/response logging.
